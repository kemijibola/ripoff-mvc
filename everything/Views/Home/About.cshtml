                <h4>Who We Are</h4>

                <p>
                    <a href="https://ripoff.com.ng" class="text-info font-bold">www.ripoff.com.ng</a> is a consumer service complaint platform focused on ensuring that companies, businesses, individuals produce and deliver goods and services in accordance with consumer protection Act of 1992. The aim of the platform is to ensure businesses in Nigeria improve on the quality of goods and services they provide to consumers in Nigeria and to ensure business owners are held responsible and liable for their shortcomings. Rip-Off NG&trade; with its legal team would follow up and make sure cases reach a logical conclusion. The obtainable reliefs for any reported and possibly litigated consumer protection case would either be replacement of the product, refund of the purchase price or in cases where the consumer has suffered irreparable damage and untold loss from the use or non-use of such product or service, the consumer would be entitled to compensation.

                <h4>Why We Started</h4>

                <p>
                    Two years ago, while surfing the internet, we came across a thread on a blog, where a guy was complaining bitterly about the product that was delivered to him from an online e-commerce site, he said he had called their customer service but they haven't replaced the product. And for hours we kept pondering, why don't we have a platform that works with the legal system to educate Nigerians on what steps to be taken on issues like this? So, we started with the model of the project, wrote proposals to few legal firms and we kicked off the project. A year ago, a senior colleague from the university also complained on Facebook about how he had sent back a new phone he bought to the phone company and haven't gotten a replacement after 2 months. This gave birth to a burning desire towards the pursuit of a better consumers protection service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the most paramount goals of  <a href="https://ripoff.com.ng" class="text-info font-bold">www.ripoff.com.ng</a> is to, among others, eliminate hazardous products from the market, provide speedy redress to consumers complaints, make publications that will lead to increased consumer awareness, ensure that consumers interest receive due consideration at the appropriate forum, and encourage trade, industry and professional associations to develop and enforce in their various fields, quality standards designed to safeguard the interest of consumers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While using all legitimate means to eliminate the scourge of consumer rights abuse in the Nigerian market place, we are conscious of the fact that an uninformed consumer population cannot be effectively protected if they do not know that they have rights, what the rights are, and how the rights could be protected. Businesses also need to be well acquainted with their obligations to consumers. It is our hope that with the co-operation of all market players, our country will become a better consumer-friendly nation.
                </p>
